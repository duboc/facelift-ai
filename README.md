# Facelift AI: Your AI-powered Image & Video Studio

Facelift AI is a web application that leverages the power of Google's Gemini API to provide a seamless and intuitive creative experience. Users can edit images with simple text prompts and generate dynamic videos from a single static image.

The application features a clean, tab-based interface allowing users to easily switch between the Image Editor and the Video Generator.
